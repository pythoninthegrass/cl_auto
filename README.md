## TODO
* Loop through `url` column and open each page in Playwright
    * ~~Keep Playwright open until each tab is closed~~ (timeout or ctrl-c workaround)
    * Headless option (i.e., don't open Playwright window, just capture results)
* [argparse](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/)
* [Dockerize script](https://github.com/pythoninthegrass/docker-python)
* Add SMTP
    * Google API account for mail server
    * Email csv
* Cron job to mail results weekly
* Convert to k8s pod
* Deploy to web host (e.g., AWS, Digital Ocean)
